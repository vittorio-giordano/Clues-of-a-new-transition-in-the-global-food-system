# Clues of a new transition in the global food system
This repository contains the code and the data used to perform the analyses of the work *Giordano, V., Tuninetti, M., Laio, F., (2025). Clues of a new transition in the global food system*, which analyses historical data of dietary composition to investigate transitions in the global food system.

## Data Overview
Dietary Energy Supply (DES) reflects the food supply available for human consumption, converted to per capita energy supply and expressed as a share of the total dietary caloric supply (% Kcal/capita/day). DES data is available for 15 food-items: animal fats, bovine Meat, pig-meat, poultry Meat, eggs, milk (excluding butter), fish, seafood, cereals (excluding beer), legumes, fruits (excluding wine), starchy roots, treenuts, vegetables, vegetable oils, sugar & sweeteners; and aggregated into 4 main food groups: animal products, plant-based products, cereals and sugars. Per capita food supply data has been sourced from the FAOSTAT database through Countriesâ€™ Food Balances and has been processed according to the methodology described in the original publication.

- DES_data.nc - contains the Dietary Energy Supply (DES) data for 196 countries (on the rows), from 1960 to 2021 (on the columns), relative to 4 food categories (3rd dimension);
- DES_data_15.nc - contains the Dietary Energy Supply (DES) data for 196 countries (on the rows), from 1960 to 2021 (on the columns), relative to 15 food items (3rd dimension);
- country_name.csv - contains the names of the 196 countries for which DES data is available. They are listed in the same order as the rows of DES_data.nc and DES_data_15.nc; the first three columns store corresponding names of Countries, with slight different nomenclatures to match national statistics datasets. The following columns contain: FAO country code, ISO3 code, Region, Continent, Region code, Income Group;
- food_categories.csv - contains the names of the 15 individual food items for which DES data is available (1st column), listed in the same order as the 3rd dimension of DES_data_15.nc; the names of the 4 aggregated food categories for which DES data is available (2nd column), listed in the same order as the 3rd dimension of DES_data.nc;
- GDP_standard_2015_prices_capita.csv - contains Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for 219 countries, from 1970 to 2021, at constant 2015 US dollars value;
- country_name_GDP.csv - contains the names of the 219 countries for which GDP data is available, listed in the same order as the rows of GDP_standard_2015_prices_capita.csv;

## Scripts
- ### DES_distributions_regressions.R
  This script reads the data described above, organizes it in DES - GDP (log10 scale) distributions relative to each food category/item, and computes a second-order linear regression as well as multiple-quantile regressions for each distribution. The code contains the libraries necessary to run the script.

## Requirements

- R environment (The authors used R version 4.3.3);
- 'ncdf4' library (The authors used ncdf4 version 1.23)
- 'quantreg' library (the authors used quantreg version 5.97)

## Usage

### Set Up the Environment: 
Ensure you have a R environment with the required packages as pointed out in the subsection Requirements.

### Run the Scripts:

- Set a working directory where the data can be accessed;
- Set variables that store the data generated in each loop and do not get overwritten, where indicated in the code;
- Save your files at the end;
